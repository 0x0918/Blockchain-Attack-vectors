## Eclipse Attack

### Description:

An eclipse attack is a P2P (Peer to Peer) network-based attack. Eclipse attack can only be performed on nodes that accept incoming connections from other nodes, and not all nodes accept incoming connections.

In other words, gaining control over node access to information in a P2P network is an Eclipse attack. The attacker positions itself in such a manner that all the incoming and outgoing connections of the target are attacker nodes.
