## Timejack Attack

### Description:

Nodes in certain blockchain networks like Bitcoin depend on internal timing derived from median time reported by its peer nodes. For example, you depend on your friends to know the time. Let us say an attacker manages to put a lot of malicious people in your friends’ list, then he can manipulate your time. The first step to this attack can be an Eclipse attack on the target node. Once this attack is complete on a target node, then the target node will not accept blocks from the actual network as the timestamp of the blocks will not be in line with its timestamp. This provides an opportunity for the attacker to be double spending or do transactions with the targeted node as these transactions can’t be submitted to the actual blockchain network.
