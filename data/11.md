## Selfish Mining Attack

### Description:

Many blockchains consider the longest chain to be the truly latest version of the ledger. So a selfish miner can try to keep building blocks in stealth mode on top of the existing chain, and when he can build a lead of greater than two or more blocks than the current chain in the network, he can publish his private fork, which will be accepted as a new truth as it is the longest chain. He can do transactions in the public network just before publishing his longer stealth chain to reverse the transaction he just did.
