## Finality

### Description:

Finality is the assurance or guarantees that cryptocurrency transactions cannot 
be altered, reversed, or canceled after they are completed. The [latency](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/latency) level of [blockchain](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/blockchain) will ultimately affect the chain's finality rate.

So, finality is used to measure the amount of time one has to wait for a reasonable guarantee that crypto transactions executed on the blockchain will not be reversed or changed. In other words, they will not be lost.
