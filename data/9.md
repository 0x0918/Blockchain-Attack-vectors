## Sybil Attack

### Description:

In a Sybil attack, an attacker will flood the network with large number of nodes with pseudonymous identities and try to influence the network. These nodes, though appearing like unrelated individuals, are operated by a single operator at the back. In this case the objective is not to target one user, but a number of nodes or network as whole, and generate a fork in the ledger if possible, allowing the attacker to make double spending and other attacks.
