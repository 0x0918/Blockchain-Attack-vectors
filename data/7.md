## Race Attack

### Description:

The race attack is a particular kind of a double-spend attempt. It requires the recipient to accept payment for [unconfirmed transactions](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/learn/crypto-terms/what-is-zero-confirmation-unconfirmed-transaction).

The attacker sends the victim an unconfirmed transaction. Meanwhile, they broadcast to the network a conflicting transaction. Since the victim observed their own transaction first, they believe they will be paid. However, since the rest of the network saw the double-spend first, itâ€™s likely that the victim will not get the money.

Such an attack is significantly easier to carry out when the attacker has a direct connection to the victim's [node](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/learn/crypto-terms/what-is-node) and deposits the conflicting transaction directly to the [miners](https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/learn/crypto-terms/what-is-miner).
