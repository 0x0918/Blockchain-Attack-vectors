## Attacks targeting cryptography

### Description:

It is believed that future quantum computers will significantly outperform traditional systems in terms of processing power. Some analysts think this evolution will make itself felt [in a decade](https://www.forbes.com/sites/amycastor/2017/08/25/why-quantum-computings-threat-to-bitcoin-and-blockchain-is-a-long-way-off/#571ff0ed2882) or so. These predictions are making Bitcoin aficionados feel nervous, and here’s why.

The factorization issue is one of the major pitfalls in this context. Quantum algorithms, such as [Shor’s algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm), may be capable of cracking RSA encryption. In theory, this might undermine the security of digital signatures used in blockchain 
platforms.
